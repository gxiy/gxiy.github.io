## About Me

I am a mechanical engineering student at Rice University in Houston, TX.
If I'm not troubleshooting
laser cutters in the engineering lab, you'll find me playing violin with
the band, reading books or drawing in the hammocks, or taking power naps
in the library.

My background is in engineering design and production. I was a 
design intern as part of Rice University's SEED (Summer Experience in Engineering
Design) program and an engineering intern at Barnes Aerospace (Windsor, CT). 
I'm set to graduate college on May 2021, and am excited to see where my 
career takes me from there.

## About The Website
This website is hosted by Github Pages and powered by Jekyll, a static
site generator. I used Jekyll Now to expedite the front setup, and built my
site from there. This represents my first foray into the world of web development, 
so treat this site gently and rest assured that it will become prettier over time. 
All the website source code is available on 
[Github](https://github.com/xiaoyaogao/xiaoyaogao.github.io).
