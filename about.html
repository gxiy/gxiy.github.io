	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		I am a mechanical engineering student at Rice University in Houston, TX.
		Currently, I work as a technician in the Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen,
		Rice's engineering makerspace. If I'm not troubleshooting
		laser cutters in the engineering lab, you'll find me playing violin with
		the band, reading books or drawing in the hammocks, or taking power naps
		in the library.
	</p>
	<p>
		Professionally, I've worked in a range of fields and specialties,
		from product design in healthcare to aerospace manufacturing. I'm always
		seeking to improve myself and gain new experiences.

	<h2>About this Website</h2>
	<p>
		This website is hosted by Github Pages and powered by Jekyll, a static
		site generator. I used <a href='https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now'>Jekyll Now</a>
		to expedite the front setup, and built my site from there. 
		This represents my first foray into the world of web development, 
		so treat this site gently and rest assured that it will become prettier over time. 
		All the website source code is available on 
		<a href = 'https://github.com/xiaoyaogao/xiaoyaogao.github.io'>Github</a>.
