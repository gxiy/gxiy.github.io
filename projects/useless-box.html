<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	The useless box is a machine designed to have no practical value. 
	Upon pressing the switch, a finger will pop from under the lid to
	flick the switch back in protest, thus starting an endless cycle of 
	turning on and turning back off again.
</p>
<p>
	The useless box is also something I've been dying to build ever 
	since I heard of the idea and browsed through many 
	<a href = 'https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-build-another-useless-machine-easy-to-make-/'>Instructables tutorials</a>
	for inspiration. The box represents my first complete project with 
	the Arduino, and provided me many adventures in soldering, 
	laser cutting, and generally
	integrating electronic and mechanical components together.	
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Overall, the box consists of a laser cut frame with two servo-controlled
	wooden "fingers" mounted inside. Pressing the power button near the base
	activates the whole system and turns on the red power LED. 
	Upon pushing the metal switch, the first finger will lift the box lid,
	allowing the second finger to rise and push the switch back.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of using a simple circuit, I controlled the box using an 
	Arduino microcontroller, to customize the motions of the fingers. There
	are around five programmed movement sequences the fingers can take every time the 
	switch is pressed, a few of them demonstrating how exasperated they are
	with the user disturbing their peace.
</p>

<p>
	I initially prototyped the box using cardboard and a breadboard. The 
	electronics were soldered to a perfboard once the circuit diagram was
	finalized. Determining the best placement of the servo fingers to 
	press the switch and lift the lid proved difficult, since the box
	had limited space due to the battery pack and wires. After several 
	iterations though, the useless box came alive!
</p>

<p>
	After enduring a long fall semester during junior year, I 
	picked a graveyard theme for the box and painted the fingers with a 
	zombie-like green. I think the theme of death and irritation is relatable
	for all engineering students, but the project itself was a really fun
	outlet for me.
