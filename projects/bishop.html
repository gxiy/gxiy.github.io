<p>I created a chess bishop piece using molding and casting.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I worked with a partner to bishop for our final Prototpying and 
Fabrication project.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Creating the bishop required the following steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Finding a 3D file of the piece</li>
	<li>CNC milling a positive of the file</li>
	<li>Combining the two halves to form a full piece, and pouring
	cast material into the mold to create the final piece</li>
</ul>

<p>We obtained the 3D file of the chess piece from 
<a href='https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2748742'>Thingiverse</a>. 
To prepare the CNC positive, I imported the .stl file into Fusion360, where 
I could orient the model and specify settings for CNC milling.</p>
<p>The majority of the heartache in the project involved testing out
correct settings for CNC milling, including selecting correct feedrates,
end mills, cutting ramp type, etc.</p>
<p>We used the Carvey, a desktop CNC machine, to cut out two positives
of the bishop from wooden blocks. Then, we poured silicone mold onto the
positives to create negatives used for casting.</p>
<p>The marble effect for the bishop pieces was made by mixing different
colored dye with the casting material. Removing the bishops from the
mold after casting was very easy and simple. For post-processing,
I sanded the bishops and used acrylic spray to waterproof the surface.</p>
