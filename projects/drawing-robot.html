<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	For my graduate-level Robotics class, I worked in a team of 3 students
	to design and simulate a working drawing robot that can process and 
	reproduce any high-contrast JPG or PNG file. Several of us on the team
	being art enthusiasts, the robot provided a fun challenge in robotic
	design, kinematics, and image processing.
</p>

<p>
	The robot itself 
	consists of a 3DOF (RRP) arm that uses two revolute joints to move a 
	two-joint arm within a planar XY coordinate frame and a prismatic joint 
	to move its pen onto and off of the paper within the Z axis. This robot 
	runs using software that can process the uploaded high-contrast image 
	and develop a drawing path for the robot consisting of continuous lines 
	and smooth transitions between those drawn lines.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Beginning with design, the robot will be controlled with basic servo 
	motors for all three joints. The end effector is a standard pen / marker 
	positioned to be able to draw on the paper. The two revolute joints 
	allow the robot to move its arm in a XY coordinate plane and reach all 
	points on a standard 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper, assuming it is placed 
	about an inch away from the middle of the long edge of the paper.
	We created a rudimentary CAD model of the robot in SolidWorks.
</p>

<p>
	To simulate the robot in MATLAB, we first calculated the forward and 
	inverse kinematics for the joints to allow the robot to position 
	its links given values of joint angles or determine the optimal joint
	angles to reach a specific pont.
</p>

<p>
	The simulation allows the user to input any image file for the robot 
	to draw. The image processing code receives the image file (jpg or png), 
	the virtual paper dimensions, and the virtual paper location, and 
	outputs a matrix of xyz coordinates for the image path trajectory. We 
	utilized the MATLAB image processing toolbox and conducted literature
	reviews to determine the best image scaling algorithms.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, I created a user-friendly GUI using MATLAB AppDesigner. The 
	GUI allows the user to select from a pre-determined list of images,
	or upload their own image for the robot to draw.
