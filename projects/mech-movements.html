<h2>Background</h2>
<p>For my Prototyping and Fabrication class in college, I was tasked
with creating a physical 
mechanical model from one of the examples in 
<a href = 'http://507movements.com/mm_127.html'>507 Mechanical Movements</a>,
a website containing drawings of various mechanical movements, such as 
gear, pulley and hydraulic assemblies. </p>
<p>I selected movement 127, a reciprocating rack and gear combo as my
model base.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p> After choosing movement 127, the reciprocating rack and pinion immediately 
reminded me of a seesaw,
with the racks presenting two people moving up and down.</p>

<p>Before I could begin the fun part of stylizing the movement,
I created a 2D drawing of the basic rack and pinion using Adobe
Illustrator, to test the dimensions and orientations of the rack and gears
necessary for the model to work. Using a laser cutter, I cut out all the 
necessary components for my first prototype using cardboard. Cardboard
is a flimsy and pathetic material for gear building, but allowed me to 
verify the feasibility of my model. I used a spur gear builder website 
to image files for the rack and pinion for my desired pitch and toothcount.</p>

<p>I then moved on to creating a second prototype using wood. I faced a lot 
of difficult in getting the components to move smoothly together, and 
created a Solidworks model to find the best spacing between the racks and 
pinion.</p>

<p>After a lot of trial and error with dimensioning and tolerancing, I 
finally began to stylize the model. Instead of people, I imagined the
racks as palm trees and the central gear as a sun. I plasma cut an 
aluminum see-saw doweled to the central gear, and added toucans on
either side of the see-saw.</p>
