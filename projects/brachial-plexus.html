<p>I designed and created a model for brachial plexus 
palsy as part of Rice University's Summer Experience in Engineering Design
Program (SEED).</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Brachial plexus palsy is a condition involving the loss of nerve
function in the brachial plexus, the nerves that control the shoulder
and arm. It affects primarily newborn infants. Although most infants
can recover nerve function, prevention requires physical therapy exercises
5-7 times a day. Our client, a physical therapist at Texas 
Children's Hospital, wanted 
a simple model to allow parents to learn the exercises before performing
the exercises on their children.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I worked with a team of 4 students to develop an educational model for 
infant brachial plexus palsy therapy. My team followed the engineering
design process which included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identifying the problem</li>
	<li>Defining design objectives and constraints</li>
	<li>Brainstorming ideas</li>
	<li>Building prototypes</li>
	<li>Testing the final product</li>
</ul>
<p>We gave our client frequent updates and collaborated with him to 
develop our prototypes.</p>
<p>Our final product consisted of a model with two shoulder joints (one
mimicking a joint affected by palsy, the other mimicking a regular joint).
The model could demonstrate four physical therapy exercises and the effect
of brachial plexus palsy on the joint when performing the exercises.</p>
