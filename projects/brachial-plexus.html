<p>I designed and created a model for brachial plexus 
palsy as part of Rice University's Summer Experience in Engineering Design
Program (SEED).</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
As part of Rice University's Summer Experience in Engineering Design
Program (SEED), I worked with a team of the 4 students to develop an educational 
model for the Texas Children's Hospital. Our client, a physical therapist,
specialized in the treatment of brachial plexus palsy.
</p>
<p>
Brachial plexus palsy is a condition involving the loss of nerve
function in the brachial plexus, the nerves that control the shoulder
and arm. It affects primarily newborn infants. Although most infants
can recover nerve function, prevention requires physical therapy exercises
5-7 times a day. 
</p>
<p>
Our team was tasked with creating a simple model to allow parents to 
learn the exercises before performing them on their children.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>To develop an educational model for 
infant brachial plexus palsy therapy, my team followed a design process
that included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identifying the problem</li>
	<li>Defining design objectives and constraints</li>
	<li>Brainstorming ideas</li>
	<li>Building prototypes</li>
	<li>Testing the final product</li>
</ul>
<p>We gave our client frequent updates and collaborated with him to 
develop our prototypes.</p>
<p>Our final product consisted of a model with two shoulder joints. The 
markings on the two scapulas indicate whether the joint behaves normally
(check mark) or behaves abnormally (x mark, sign of palsy). 
The model could demonstrate four physical therapy exercises and the effect
of brachial plexus palsy on the joint when performing the exercises.</p>
<p>The model is primarily made of laser cut wood. The scapulas are attached
to the body by compression springs surrounded by heat shrink tubing, and
the wooden arms are attached to the body by clasps, torsion springs, and 
some 3D printed components.</p>
