<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The shopping cart was created for a final modeling and simulation project.
My group was tasked with modeling an object from scratch
and simulating common loading conditions on the object. 
</p>
<p>The dimensions for the shopping cart were based off of Patent US D530478S
and modified for our needs. All modeling and simulations were done using
Solidworks.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
I was responsible for creating drawings and models for the bottom portion
of the cart (including the bottom platform and wheel supports). 
</p>
<p>
As a group, we simulated three diffferent loading conditions on the cart:
	<ul>
		<li>Uniform downward force of 75 lb on basket(weight of heavy groceries)</li>
		<li>Uniform downward force on both basket and bottom platform</li>
		<li>Uniform downward force on basket, with one unsupported wheel 
		(worst case condition, representing a cart with a wheel dangling 
		above a ditch)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
We created graphs of the von Mises equivalent stress and displacement for
the cart under each condition, and located areas of maximum stress or 
displacement. We analyzed whether any condition would cause material failure,
and reviewed possible design changes to improve the cart (adding additional
fillets, reinforcing the wheel axel support, etc.).
