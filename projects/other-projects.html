<p>The following projects are smaller projects that were still a lot of 
fun to do.</p>

<div class = 'proj-img'>

	alt ='fish'/>
		<figcaption>Plasma-cut Fish</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>
<p>Plasma cut fish post-processed with the sand-blaster. I tried painting
the surface with a blue gradient effect.</p>

<div class= 'proj-img'>

		<figcaption>Laser-cut Box (top)</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>
<p>Laser cut box with many compartments. Getting the tolerances correct
for a perfect snap-fit was difficult, and not quite successful. Regardless,
this box was a great learning experience in laser-cutting and careful 
dimensioning.</p>

<div class = 'proj-img'>
	<figure>
		<img src = '{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3d-skull.jpg' 
	alt ='skull'/>
		<figcaption>Voronoi Skull</figcaption></figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>
<p>Skull printed using a Makerbot (file pulled from 
<a href = 'https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1398223'>Thingiverse</a>). 
I'm surprised it came out as well as it did, considering the 
intricate design and the lack of support used!</p>
